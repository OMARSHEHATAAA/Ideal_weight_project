# ⚖️ Project: Ideal Weight Prediction using AI

This project demonstrates how to use a simple machine learning model (Linear Regression) to **predict a person's ideal weight** based on:
- Height (cm)
- Age (years)
- Gender (Male/Female)

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `ideal_weight_dataset.csv`: Sample dataset used for training/testing.
- `ideal_weight_prediction_notebook.ipynb`: Colab-ready notebook with full workflow.
- `ideal_weight_prediction.py`: Python script version.
- `README.md`: Project documentation in English.

---

## 📊 What’s Inside the Notebook?

1. **Loading and visualizing the dataset**.
2. **Data preprocessing**: Label encoding gender.
3. **Splitting the data**: 80% training, 20% testing.
4. **Training a Linear Regression model**.
5. **Model evaluation**: Using R² score and MSE.
6. **Prediction example**: Predict weight for a new input.

## 🚀 How to Run It

### Option 1: On Google Colab
1. Upload the notebook and CSV file to Colab.
2. Run all cells in sequence.

### Option 2: Locally (Python Script)
1. Make sure Python + libraries (`pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) are installed.
2. Place both `ideal_weight_prediction.py` and `ideal_weight_dataset.csv` in the same folder.
3. Run:
```bash
python ideal_weight_prediction.py
```

## 📌 Notes

- The dataset is synthetic and for educational/demo purposes only.
- You can improve the model by adding more features (e.g., activity level, diet, etc.)
